Assignmet # 6

This assignment aims to evaluate the use of Azure storage for storing files residing currently in on-premises data stores. While majority of these files are not accessed frequently, there are some exceptions. I would like to minimize cost of storage by placing less frequently accessed files in lower-priced storage tiers. I also plan to explore different protection mechanisms that Azure Storage offers, including network access, authentication, authorization, and replication. Finally, I want to testing the Azure File Share operation. 

I completed the assignment in 6 steps. These steps are:

•	Task 1: Provision the lab environment:
In this step  from cloud shell panel ,run some code and c virtual machines, networks, subnets, and their componentes have been created.

•	Task 2: Create and configure Azure Storage accounts:
In this task, I created and configured an Azure Storage account.

•	Task 3: Manage blob storage:
In this task,I created a blob container and uploaded a blob into it.

•	Task 4: Manage authentication and authorization for Azure Storage:
In this task, I configured authentication and authorization for Azure Storage. First tested the file URL adresse on browser, then created SAS, again tested the entering.  And also changed the role then again testing the entering. 

•	Task 5: Create and configure an Azure Files shares:
In this task, I created and configured Azure Files shares.Then a folder and a txt file is created using powershell command line. 

•	Task 6: Manage network access for Azure Storage:
